# CNN
Convolutional Neural Network in R  
The framework is tailored for experimentation not production environements.  
Netowrk assumes a default architecture as follows:  
(CONV-CONV-POOL)x3 - FCx3  
Customized architectures can be input by filling the arch table  
The framework assumes a padding non overlapping of size 2  
Filter sizes and steps can be set manually
